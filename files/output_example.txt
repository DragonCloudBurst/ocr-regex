Factors Behind School Dropouts Have Roots In Earlier Years

By JERRY RAY.NOR Reflector Staff Writer

School adrainiitrators in the Pitt County and Greenville City Schools agree on the basic premise that factors behind dropouts from school are not generally ones that result in a students sudden decision to quit school, but often have their roots in earBer school years.

A recent report compiled by the N. C. Department of Public Instruction reveals that the dropout rate for school year 1982-83 was 5.2 percent for the Greenville City Schools, and 7.2 percent for the Pitt County Schools.

"In general, most dropouts occur in the tenth grade, after a

student turns 16," Dr. Delma Blinson, superintendent of the city schools remarked. "But the problem basically goes back

much farther. Often we can ientify a potential dropout as early as the second, third and fourth grades. Young students who have trouble with their studies,who fall behind in their work, lose interest, become defiant and are disciplinary problems, are likely to be eventual dropout candidates.

usually end up graduating," Blinson added. I feel that for reliable indications of dropouts in high school, its good to take a look at students who are 10 to 12 years old. Much

depends on the question of how much communication takes place between a child and parents about school. If the answer IS virtually zero, the student is a potential drop out.

Blinson feels one of the most effective dropout prevention approaches "is finding a way for a student to study to be successful in his school work, to learn to read and write effectively. Young student who can do this are more likely to feel good about being in school. When this happens, a student can face problems with confidence."


"There are no gimoicks to prevent dropout," Blinstm remarked. I feel strongly that the two most important elements to dropout prevention is that a student early learns to read, write, and compute, and to have teachers who really care. These two factors are the bottom line. "

John McKnight, assistant superintendent for instruction in the Pitt County Schools, said "the droput rates as a whole have to be loed at statistically in grades nine through twelve. One phenomena that is happening in the schools is that we are holding students longer. Some under-achievers in the past dropped out earlier and were not reflected in statistics, whereas now with students staying in school longer, it has reached the point where statistics do reflect them, and that makes a difference in reports on the subject."
