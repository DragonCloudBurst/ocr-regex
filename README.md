# Regular Expressions script for OCR text

This is a simple Python script that cleans up text generated by OCR programs such as Tesseract to make it more legible. It primarily removes special characters such as the caret `^`, unknown character `�`, tilde `~`, and pipe `|`. Common escape codes
for special characters- `&quot;`, `&nbsp;`, and `&amp;`- are replaced with the appropriate character instead. Finally, trailing punctuation and slashes at the end of a line that appears after whitespace is also removed.

## Dependencies

- Python 3.6 or higher
- Typer (can be easily installed with `pip install typer`)
- A plaintext file of text to be processed

## Installation / Download

- Simply clone the respository via git. No installation is needed. 

## Use of Script

- Place the txt file of text that you want to clean up in the `files` directory.
- Call the script from the command line as follows (Note that the exact command to call Python may vary depending on your OS / distribution / etc. (python vs python3)): `python ocrRegex.py "files/path to your text file.txt"`
- If there are no spaces in the filename, you may omit the quotation marks. As follows: `python ocrRegex.py files/path_to_your_text_file.txt`
- The output file will be named `output_<initial file name>.txt` and will automatically be placed within the files directory. For example, if your file was named `document1.txt1`, the new file wil be named `output_document1.txt`.

## Output Examples

- Plenty of program output examples can be seen under the `files` directory. These can be deleted after cloning the repository if you desire. One of the best "before and after" examples is [example8.txt](https://github.com/DragonCloudBurst/ocr-regex/blob/main/files/example8.txt) and [output_example8.txt](https://github.com/DragonCloudBurst/ocr-regex/blob/main/files/output_example8.txt). All examples are taken from real OCR text.
