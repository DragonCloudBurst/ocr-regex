# Regular Expressions script for OCR text

This is a simple Python script that cleans up text generated by OCR programs such as Tesseract to make it more legible. It primarily removes special characters such as the caret `^`, unknown character `�`, tilde `~`, and pipe `|`. Common escape codes
for special characters- `&quot;`, `&nbsp;`, `&gt;`, `&lt;`, and `&amp;`- are replaced with the appropriate character instead. Finally, trailing punctuation and slashes at the end of a line that appears after whitespace is also removed.

## Dependencies

- Python 3.6 or higher
- Typer (can be easily installed with pip install typer)
- A plaintext file of text to be processed

## Installation / Download
